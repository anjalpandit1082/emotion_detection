Emotion Detection using Google Colab

Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Emotion Detection from Text using Python. The notebook is designed to run smoothly on Google Colab, leveraging its free GPU and cloud environment.

The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify emotions expressed in text data.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Text vectorization using TF-IDF or other embeddings

Training machine learning models for emotion classification

Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Visualization of results

How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab:
Open in Colab

Run the notebook cells step-by-step to train and test the emotion detection model.

You can upload your own text data and try the model for emotion prediction.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk (You can install these using pip in Colab)
